If you need help configuring it try asking people in the group chat.

Bugs can be posted in the discussion forum for them in the HoxHud group, and if you

If you want to disable the "HoxHud Initialised" Voice line that was kindly contributed by Old Hoxton (Pete Gold)
Simply delete the MP3 from the HoxHud folder.

Disclaimer:

HoxHUD is an incomplete mod for Payday 2. 
We do not guarantee that HoxHUD is compatible with your computer, any other mods, or clients you are using. 
Wine-Bottled Payday 2 is not supported actively, hacked clients are not supported and any mods that you have that run in conjunction with HoxHUD can potentially cause crashing.

To better your HoxHUD experience, read the forums and atttempt to keep redundant modding to the ABSOLUTE minimum.
If you have any questions, remember there's a search bar for the forums that will probably get you answers, 
whereas reposting garbage that we've already answered will result in some moderators verbally berating you in a manner roughly equivalent to being beaten with a hard-backed, unabridged copy of Homer's "The Odessey"
